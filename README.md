# editThatNextMaster
Script for RoboFont: makes switching glyph,space and font windows super easy.

If you're editing masters or whatever and you want to switch to the same glyph in the other master
and you spend a lot of time moving glyph windows around or you've had to divide your
massive pixel real estate into small lots.

Add this script to RF and wire it to a key command and then woosh woosh woosh cycle between the masters.

The other script, *editThatNextMaster.py* wooshes the other direction.
The order in which these scripts woosh through the fonts: alphabetically sorted filepath.
